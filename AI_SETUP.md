# 🤖 AI Chat Setup Guide

## 🚀 Real Gemini AI Integration

Your floating robot now uses **Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash** model for intelligent conversations!

## 🔑 Getting Your Gemini API Key

2. **Sign in** with your Google account
3. **Click "Create API Key"** 
4. **Copy** the generated API key

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. **Open your `.env` file** in the project root
2. **Replace the demo key** with your actual API key:
   ```env
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Restart your dev server**: `npm run dev`

## 🧠 Knowledge Base

The AI uses the `public/knowledge.txt` file as its knowledge base about Abdul. You can:
- **Update the knowledge** by editing this file
